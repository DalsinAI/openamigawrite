# OpenWrite: formats

Version 0.1 | 4 October 2026 | Dalsin Limited, MIT

Every format OpenWrite opens or saves, what we know about it, and where that
knowledge comes from. The design is in [../DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md), section 4.

**Where the knowledge comes from:**
- **Spec:** a published specification.
- **Sample:** documents we make ourselves with the original program in the
  format lab (DESIGN.md, section 4.2), and our own old documents.
- **Reference:** someone else's converter, read for understanding only. Code
  is reused only when its licence allows it, with credit.

**State:** *To do* until a filter is written; then *Text* (the text comes
back), *Formatting* (paragraphs and character formatting) and *Full* (all
that the format holds and OpenWrite can show).

## 1. Today's documents

## 2. Amiga text formats

| ANSI text, with the Amiga console's style and colour codes | Yes | No | Spec: ECMA-48 | W2 | To do |

## 3. Amiga word processors

The list we know of. More will turn up on old disks, and each gets a row
here.

| Program | Maker, years | Container | What we know | Phase | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ProWrite | New Horizons Software, 1987-1993 | IFF `FORM WORD` | Spec (New Horizons, 1987): `FONT`, `COLR`, `DOC`, `HEAD`, `FOOT`, `PARA`, `TABS`, `PAGE`, `TEXT`, `FSCC` (font, style and colour changes), `PCTS`/`PINF` with an ILBM `BODY` for pictures; measures in decipoints (1/720 inch) | W2 | To do |
| QuickWrite | New Horizons Software | Probably IFF `FORM WORD` | To confirm from a sample | W2 | To do |
| Final Writer, Final Copy and Final Copy II | SoftWood, 1990-1997 | IFF | Reference: fw2odf (MIT, Python) reads `ATTR` (font sizes) and is working on `RULE` (spacing and tabs). Sample | W2 | To do |
| Wordworth | Digita, 1992-1999 | IFF, its own form `WTXT`; an older Wordworth 3 format too | Sample. Wordworth could save RTF, which gives us a second copy of each sample to check against | W2 | To do |
| Excellence! and Scribble! | Micro-Systems Software | Their own | Sample | W2 | To do |
| Kindwords | The Disc Company, 1987 | Its own | Sample | W2 | To do |
| Textcraft and Textcraft Plus | Arktronics for Commodore, 1985-1986 | Their own | Sample | W2 | To do |
| Pen Pal | SoftWood, 1990 | Its own | Sample | W2 | To do |
| Protext | Arnor | Text with embedded commands | Sample, and its manual | W2 | To do |
| BeckerText | Data Becker | Its own | Sample | W2 | To do |
| WordPerfect for the Amiga | WordPerfect Corporation, 1987-1989 | WordPerfect 4.x | Believed close to WordPerfect 4.2 for DOS. Reference: libwpd. Sample | W2 | To do |
| AmigaWriter | Haage & Partner, about 2000-2001 (2.2) | To find out | Sample. A demo (2.20) is on Aminet as `text/dtp/AW2.20-Demo.lha` | W2 | To do |
| Desktop publishing: PageStream, Professional Page, PageSetter | Soft-Logik, Gold Disk | Their own | Text and pictures only, later | Later | To do |

## 4. How a new Amiga format gets in

1. Make the samples in the format lab: the standard test document, then one
   change per file (bold on, a font, a tab stop, a header, a picture). If the
   program can also save RTF or text, save that copy too.
2. Write down what each chunk or record holds, in `docs/formats/<format>.md`.
3. Write the importer against the samples; the samples and their expected
   result go into the tests.
4. Set this table's state, and the import report lists anything the filter
   cannot bring across.
