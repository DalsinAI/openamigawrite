# OpenWrite

A word processor for AmigaOS 3.2 that opens and saves today's documents
(DOCX and ODT) and opens the documents written with the Amiga's own word
processors: ProWrite, Final Writer, Wordworth, Final Copy, Excellence!,
Kindwords, Textcraft and the rest. It prints, saves PDF, and works like an
Amiga program: a GadTools window, Amiga keys, the clipboard and ARexx.

We, 4 October 2026: "let's do the OpenWrite project", a word processor "that
can import any of the Amiga formats, along with DOCX and the OpenDocument
formats".

Status, 4 October 2026: designed (version 0.1), and phase W1 started.
`DESIGN.md` is the design and `docs/FORMATS.md` the list of formats.
libowf 0.1 reads IFF FTXT, ProWrite (IFF WORD), ANSI text and plain text,
and writes ODT, DOCX, HTML, FTXT and plain text. Reading ODT and DOCX, and
RTF, come next.

Its editor is WebCore, the engine inside WebKit, from our OpenBrowser port
(`DalsinAI/openamigabrowser`). Its file formats are a separate C library,
**libowf**, with a Shell command, **C:OWConvert**, that converts documents on
any Amiga, a 68000 included.

Part of the Open family: it builds on OpenBrowser, OpenGadTools and
OpenPrint rather than bundling its own versions of them.

## Building and testing

On Linux (the tests need Python 3 and zlib):

```
make            # build/host/owconvert
make test       # the filter tests
make check      # the same under AddressSanitizer and UBSan
```

For AmigaOS 3.x, any 68000, with bebbo's amiga-gcc 6.5 (the `os32` stove):

```
ZLIB_SRC=/path/to/zlib-1.3 ./build-os3.sh      # build/os3/OWConvert
```

Without `ZLIB_SRC`, ODT files are stored rather than deflated, which every
reader accepts.
